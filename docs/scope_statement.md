# Scope Statement

## Project Scope
The scope of the mobile banking application project is to develop a highly secure, user-friendly mobile banking platform that allows customers to manage their accounts, transfer funds, pay bills, and receive real-time notifications. The project includes full integration with the bank's backend systems and compliance with all necessary security and banking regulations.

## Inclusions
- Development of core banking functionalities such as:
  - Account management (view balances, transaction history).
  - Fund transfers (internal and external).
  - Bill payments.
  - Notifications and alerts (transaction confirmations, low balance alerts).
- Deployment of the app on both iOS and Android platforms.
- Full integration with the bankâ€™s existing backend systems (e.g., core banking, payment processing, and account systems).
- Implementation of robust security measures, including encryption and multi-factor authentication.
- User acceptance testing (UAT) and staff training prior to launch.

## Exclusions
- Development of a web-based version of the application (mobile-only focus for this phase).
- Support for new, non-core features such as investment tracking or credit score monitoring.
- Ongoing post-launch maintenance beyond the initial support period.
